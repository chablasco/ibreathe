<p><em>I Breathe</em> is a new digital artwork by Cha Blasco where he explores air quality and pollution index in real-time by using data sonification, a process where data information is transformed into sound and music and the audience gets an interactive and emotional experience of the air we breathe. Cha Blasco is greatly involved in climate issues and wants to inspire us to critically self-reflect by giving us a greater insight into the health risks we have before us.
</p>
<p>
<em>I Breathe</em> is presented as a web-based audio-visual installation where the individual user will experience a worldwide cartographic journey which constantly changes air quality and pollution index in real-time. 
</p>
<p>
The Air Quality Index is based on measurements of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. Most of the stations on the map are monitoring both PM2.5 and PM10 data, but there are few exceptions where only PM10 is available. All measurements are based on hourly readings.
</p>

<p>
<em>I Breathe</em> was created out of the performing arts project <em>Jag Vill Se Stjärnorna</em> (I Want To See The Stars) by Teater Eksem (premiere in 2018) where four actors in a documentary manner explore climate crisis and parenthood.
